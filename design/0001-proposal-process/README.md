# Proposal Process

Ockam Proposals are design documents that would be openly discussed by the Ockam community
before a feature is implemented. A proposal describes the motivation for a feature along with
a technical specification for how it could be implemented within Ockam.

## Description

# Proposal Process

1. The first step in creating a proposal is to create an [issue][issues] that describes the
problem you would like to address with a feature in [ockam][ockam].

2. After some community feedback on the issue, the proposed feature is written into a draft
proposal document that describes the motivation for that feature along with a technical
specification for how it could be implemented within [ockam][ockam].

3. This draft proposal is reviewed and merged via a pull request.

4. The proposal then goes through several iterations of prototype implementations and
design improvements before it becomes a feature in a released version of [ockam][ockam].
