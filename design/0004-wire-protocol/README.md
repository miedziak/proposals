# Wire Protocol

This document specifies a binary 'on-the-wire' protocol for two entities
to communicate over a network connection.

The format is formally [specified](prototype/ockam_wire/ockam_wire.ksy)
as a declarative [Kaitai Struct](kaitai.io). A prototype [encoder-decoder](prototype/codec.exs)
in Elixir is also included.
